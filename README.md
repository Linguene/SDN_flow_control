# SDN_flow_control
The aim of this project was to create a network based on a developed topology using tools such as MININET with the ONOS controller. The network was to be automated using a python program that, based on the nodes (cities from the topology) specified by the user, would find the shortest path and, by creating the appropriate rules in JSON files, would also send requests through a REST API.
