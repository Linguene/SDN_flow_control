# SDN_flow_control
The goal of this project was to create a network based on a developed topology using tools such as MININET with the ONOS controller. The network was meant to be automated using a python program that, based on the nodes (cities from the topology) specified by the user, would find the shortest path and would set the appropiate flow rules (REST API)
